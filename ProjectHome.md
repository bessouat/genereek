**GenerEEK** is a **web framework** build to make new web technology **simple** and **funky**.

  * **Most of** the web framework are **difficult to use**(_if you don't know very well development method's_) **or too simple** to do everything you want.
  * So even if you are a **good developer** that take **time to develop** new application.
  * Some new move are **very interesting** (_like AIR, Silverlight or JavaFX_) but it's counting on **setup an external program/plugin**.
  * More you have program's on your computer more you **risk to have security issues**.

Here we propose a system to use all the good part of the **new technology**.

  * The framework load (download) only a basic system environment and load (download) step by step others modules/templates if you need it.
  * Made in Javascript, only **running in client environment**
  * Working on **99% of browsers**
  * **Cross domain Ajax** Technology
  * Describe your application in **XML** ... nothing else
  * **Nothing to install** on the client side, open your browser and GO
  * **Ajax**, **motion** and **event** system 100% **managed from XML**
  * **Cross Language** ? Actually supporting PHP but this framework needs only 10 line of PHP, so its really simple to use it with others language
  * **So light ...**

_You can use others new technology too with external program/plugin, but **you don't need it** to make some funky application ..._
